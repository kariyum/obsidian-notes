# Data modeling
- Queries are the driving force for data modeling.
- Primary keys are used in cassandra data bases not only for uniqueness but also for determining the perfomance of the read and writes at large scale.

## CQL Concepts
- [[#Keyspaces]]
- [[#Tables]]
- [[#Basic data types]]
- [[#Commands]]
	- Importing csv files
	- SELECT
	- TRUNCATE
	- ALTER TABLE
	- SOURCE

### Keyspaces
- Top level container that you use to organize a related set of tables. <=> Data base schema in relational databses.
```cql
CREATE KEYSPACE killrvideo
	WITH REPLICATION = {
		'class' : 'SimpleStrategy',
		'replication_factor' : 1
	};

```
- Select a keyspace to use for your subsquent commands
```cql
USE killrvideo;
```
- Otherwise include the name of the keyspace whenever you reference the name of a table.
- Keyspaces stores tables
- It is a container for replication
- It stores where your data is in relation to your cluster

### Tables
**Keyspaces contain tables and tables contain our data.**

**Basics**
```cql
CREATE TABLE table1(
	column1 TEXT,
	column2 TEXT,
	column3 INT,
	PRIMARY KEY (column1)
);

CREATE TABLE users(
	user_id UUID,
	first_name TEXT,
	last_name TEXT,
	PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
)
```
- Cassandra primary keys uniquely identify rows of data.

#### Basic data types
- **Text** (<=> varchar)
- **Int** (signed 32 bits)
	- **UUID** => Generates a Universal Unique Identifier for every entry with UUID function
- **TIMEUUID** embeds a TIMESTAMP value
	- Sortable 
	- Generate view now()
- **TIMESTAMP** represented in yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ssZ 

#### Commands
1. **COPY** 
- Works with CSV files
```cql
COPY table1 (column1, column2, column3) FROM 'table1data.csv';
```
- Header parameter skips the first line in the file
```cql
COPY table1 (column1) FROM 'table1data.csv' WITH HEADER=true;
```
- Cannot have more field than the target table --can have fewer fields.
- Missing and empty fields are set to null

2. **READ**
Pulls data from a table
```cql
SELECT * FROM table1;

SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1;
-- ^This is an expensive operation so you may consider using spark.

SELECT * FROM table1 LIMIT 10; -- This will only pull the first 10 rows.
```

3. **TRUNCATE**
Causes all rows to be deleted from table while leaving the schema in place.
- Immediately and irreversibly
- The command will fail if any of the nodes are down
- Deletes SSTables that hold the data
```cql
TRUNCATE table1;
```

4. **ALTER**
Make changes to your schema.
- Change datatype of column, add columns, drop columns, rename columns and change table properties.
- You **cannot** alter (remove) the **PRIMARY KEY** columns.
```cql
ALTER TABLE TABLE1 ADD another_column text;

ALTER TABLE TABLE1 DROP a_column;
```

5. **SOURCE**
Execute a file containing CQL statements
```cql
SOURCE './myscripts.cql'; -- outputs the output of every command
```

6. **UPDATE**
```cql
UPDATE users SET column_name = value WHERE condition=true;
```
7. **DELETE**
```cql
-- deletes a column value
DELETE id FROM cyclist WHERE lastname = 'WELTEN'  and firstname = 'Bram' IF EXISTS;

-- deletes an entire row
DELETE FROM cyclist WHERE id=yoyo1 IF EXISTS;
```

**NOTES**
- You cannot query on individual primary key if the primary key is partioned, we have more than 1 primary key defined as 
```cql
PRIMARY KEY (pr1, pr2)
```
=> you use clustering columns.

**PARTITION**
- A part of the primary key which shows where in the cluster your data is.
- Partition key defines the node on which the data is stored.
- Clustering columns defines the order of rows within a partition.
- Row is stored inside a partition.
- Apprently a way to organize data logically
- It is always the first value of the primary key
=> Partition key is hashed and then used for placement.
- Needed to fetch data --*needed for acceleration*

**PRIMARY KEYS** 
- Defines the placement of that record in the cluster.
- Contains the partition key as its' first value and the rest is what's called clustering column.

**CLUSTERING COLUMNS**
- How cassandra sorts data within each partition
- Come after partition key within **primary key** clause
```cql
CREATE TABLE videos (
	id int,
	name text,
	runtime int,
	year int,
	PRIMARY KEY ((year), name)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (name DESC); --ASC as default

```
- Where is that data inside the file. --*could be in one or more sstables*
- **Respect the order on which it was created for the qeury process**
- You can do range queries on clustering columns.
- Respect the order of the creation.

**RANGE QUERY**
```cql
SELECT * FROM videos WHERE year=2014 AND name >= 'Interstellar';
```
- You can do range queries on clustering columns.
**DATA TYPES**
- **Tinyint** : 8-bit signed integer
- **Smallint** : 16-bit signed
- **Int** : 32-bit integer
- **Bigint** : 64-bit signed integer
- **Varint** : Arbitrary-precision integer--F-8 encoded string
- **Decimal** : Variable-precision decimal, supports integers and floats.
- **Float** : 32 bits
- **Double** : 64 bits
- **Date** 32 bits unsigned => Number of days since epoch (Jan 1, 1970) --don't use this
- **Duration** Signed 64 bits --amout of time in nanoseconds
- **Time** Encoded 64 bits signed number of nanoseconds since midnight
- **Timestamp** 64 bit singed integer --date and time since epoch in ms
- **TimeUUID** a unique UUID with 64 bits for time
- **Blob** no validation, you can throw anything at it. It is stored in hexdecimal string with no bytes limitation size.
- **Boolean** as true or flase
- **Counter** inc or dec using UPDATE command, stored as 64 signed int
- **Inet** validates a IPv4 / IPv6

**CREATING User Defined Type --*UDT***

```cql
CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS video_encoding (
	encoding text,
	height int,
	width int,
		bit_rates set<text>
);

--use it in CREATE TABLE as follows :
	...
	encoding frozen<video_encoding>,
	...
```
**Questions and Answers**
1. Why can't we use **where** on non-primary key columns?
	- Beacuse it will require a scan of all partitions on all nodes, it could be anywhere.
	- Inefficient access pattern.

**Flexiable data types**
- *UDTs* user defined types
- *UDFs* user defined functions
- *UDAs* user defined aggregates
- Counters

#### Data structures
**Collections**
- Store multiple values in each cell while still keeping the values individuality.
- They are multivalued columns
- Collections are meant to store small amount of data
- Collections are retrieved in their entirety
- You cannot nest collections inside a collection --*in contrast to using the **frozen** keyword*
1. **Set**
	- Stores a set of unique values
	- Stored unordered but returned in sorted order.
	```cql
	CREATE TABLE users(
		id text PRIMARY KEY,
		fname text,
		lname text,
		emails set<text>
	);
	--Insert values
	INSERT INTO users(id, fname, lname, emails) VALUES ('cass123', 'Cassandra', 'Dev', {'cass@dev.com', 'cassd@gmail.net'});
```

2. **List**
	- Stores potentiolly duplicate values
	- Stored in a particuler order
```cql
...(
	mylist list<text>, --['Tunisia', 'Country1']
)
```

3. **Map**
	- Relate values in one another in a key-value pair
	- Ordered by unique keys
```cql
	mymap map<timestamp, text>,
	{
		'2018-1-1' : 'Create database',
		'2018-2-1' : 'Load data'
	}
```

**Using _forzen_ in a collection**
- Nested data types? => Frozen collection
- Using Frozen in a collection will serialize multiple components into a single value
- Values in a single frozen collection are treated like blobs
- Does not allow updates to individual fields
> [!info]
>  I think it's awesome if you save some json objects as a string (blob) format saved as a frozen attribute.


##### **UDFs** and **UDAs**
**UDF** is the ability for users to create their own functions in java or javascript, these functions can then be used in *SELECT*, *INSERT* and *UPDATE* statements. These user defined functions are only available in the keyspace that the user has defined them.
1. Enable couple of things in the **cassandra.yaml**
	1. JAVA : set enable_user_defined_functions = true;
	2. JS : set enable_scripted_user_defined_functions=true;

**UDA** is where you use your UDFs in some creative way to get the results you need from the cluster.

Define UDFs:
	1. You need to define the **state function** which is required which executed and process the values in every row
		- The **state function** is executed once for each row
		- The value returned by the state function becomes the new state
	2. There is also an optional function that is executed with the last state value once all the rows have been processed
**Aggregation** is performed by the coordinator.

# Conceptual data modeling
Taking all the objects of your domain and their attributes and how all of them are related together
- We have composite attributes those are who are further decomposed.
- We also have multi-valued attributes, those who are in double circles.
- Entity types
	- Like Video or Actor ...
- Relationship types
	- The relation between entities
	- When you read from LEFT to RIGHT you read the word at the top
	- Each time two objects participate in the relationship we call that an instance of the relationship.
- Weak entity type
	- The double outlines
	- In order for an object to exist the parent object and the weak entity type must also exist

	 - If the video disappears then the encoding disappears with it

![[Pasted image 20220706211540.png]]
- Know your data
- Know your queries
- Nest data
- Duplicate data

#### Nesting
Data nesting is the most data modeling technique
- Data organizes multiple entities into a single partition.
- Supports partion per query data access.
- Three data nesting mechanisms:
	- Clustering columns - multi-row partitions
	- Collection columns
	- User-defined type colums

#### Mapping rules
![[Pasted image 20220706215033.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220706215037.png]]

#### Loading Data Methods
- COPY command
	- **COPY TO** exports data from a table to csv file
	- **COPY FROM** imports data from a csv file to a table --*export* data
- SSTable loader
	- Imports data from other clusters if you already have them
	- Load pre-existing SSTables into:
		- An existing cluster or new cluster
		- A cluster with the same number of nodes or a different number of nodes
		- A cluster with a different replication strategy or partitioner
	- Example:
```cql 
		sstableloader -d @_IP /var/lib/cassandra/users
 ```
- DSE Bulk Loader

### Optimization and tuning
**Writing techniques**
For update, if you're updating a partition key you probably need to delete the oldest one and insert in a new one. Like dis:
![[Pasted image 20220707101045.png]]
Since these are independing operation and thus some may fail and some may succeed. To overcome this problem, we may use **batch** to ensure the same outcome for all of the operations.
![[Pasted image 20220707101326.png]]
- In this case all operations are sent together to the coordinator node
- The batch operation succeeds only if all operations succeed.
- No orders for operations in batches -- all writes are executed with the same timestamp
- Data can still be unconsist since read operations can occur while executing batchs
**Improuve consistency**
- Using **batch** to insert or update a table 
![[Pasted image 20220707101947.png]]

- **IF NOT EXISTS** makes the insert a *light weight transaction* 
- For **UPDATE**
 ![[Pasted image 20220707102052.png]]

#### Reading techniques
**Making use of index**
![[Pasted image 20220707102427.png]]

**For high cardinality columns** we can refer to materialized view
