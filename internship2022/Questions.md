- There are many colums that haven't been used such as hierarchy_name column, does it have any utility ?

- About generating some data, should we follow the hierarchy ? for example :
	- If this current parent is a child for another parent should they have the same data ?
	- if yes : redo the work
	- else : that's gucci
For now the data is consistent between parent and child, but not at all considering a path.
I will start working on that for now. as of THURSDAY 4:18 PM
